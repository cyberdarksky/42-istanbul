!!!!This file is not standard you must read every C__ files own RTFM because they will be different!!!!
First drag and drop these files to your cloned repo.
It will automatically add main.c files to where it needs to go.
Then go to ex__ (folder that you want to check) and compile ONLY test.c files
You must compile ONLY test.c.
When you run \a.out (test.c's compiled file) It will compile your code and testing main, and it will test automatically,
then automatickly run your compiled file and it will give you results that you have to compare.

These main not printing results for comparison. I added true results for to according main.c files.
You should look main.c' s last lines
Except ex01. ex01 Will print true results when you run it's test.

!!Reminding!!
DO NOT COMPILE YOUR CODE
ONLY COMPILE TEST.C AND RUN IT.
TEST.C WILL AUTOMATICKLY COMPILE YOUR CODE AND TESTING MAIN THEN IT WILL TEST YOUR CODE.

If you have a question you can find me in 42 istanbul.
My name is Eren and my username in intra.42.fr is mkala.
These test files could be better but there is no time for editing them, because I'm in 42-piscine.
If you have a suggestion or if you want to improve these test codes with me feel free to write on Slack or Github.
